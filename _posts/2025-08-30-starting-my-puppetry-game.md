Welcome to my blog! I'm documenting my journey creating a unique experience that combines puppetry with tabletop RPG gaming.

## The Vision
You know how people play Dungeons & Dragons around a table? Well, I'm building this puppet theater setup where I sit inside it as the game master and use puppets to play all the different characters the players meet - like the tavern keeper, villains, magical creatures, that sort of thing.

It's like combining traditional tabletop gaming with a live puppet show. The players still have their character sheets and dice, but instead of me just describing an innkeeper, I actually have a puppet that talks to them! Makes the whole experience way more theatrical and immersive.

I have built the frame out of PVC pipe and I'm working on the curtains now. It sounds crazy but it's actually really engaging - brings the story to life in a totally different way!"

## Am I crazy?
- I have a lot of skeptics, both from people outside of TTRPGs (you're doing what??) and inside of TTRPGs (you're going to need so many puppets), and to help me keep going, I am documenting my progress in a blog.  Hopefully I will find some people who believe in this concept.
- I haven't actually run a game with the puppet booth yet.  I have run many, many rpg games, but the booth is still being created.
- Puppets are expenseive!  Don't even look at Etsy, they cost so much!  My biggest challenge is making puppets for an RPG.  Why work hard on them when you know the palyers will make short work of them!

Stay tuned for updates!
