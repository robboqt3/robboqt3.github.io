Welcome to my blog! I'm documenting my journey creating a unique game that combines puppetry with interactive gaming.

## The Vision
"Oh, I've been working on this fun project! You know how people play Dungeons & Dragons around a table? Well, I'm building this puppet theater setup where I sit inside it as the game master and use puppets to play all the different characters the players meet - like the tavern keeper, villains, magical creatures, that sort of thing.
It's like combining traditional tabletop gaming with a live puppet show. The players still have their character sheets and dice, but instead of me just describing an innkeeper, I actually have a little puppet that talks to them! Makes the whole experience way more theatrical and immersive.
I just built the frame out of PVC pipe and I'm working on the red velvet curtains now. It sounds crazy but it's actually really engaging - brings the story to life in a totally different way!"

## What's Next
- Set up my workspace
- Design the first characters
- Plan the basic game mechanics

Stay tuned for updates!
