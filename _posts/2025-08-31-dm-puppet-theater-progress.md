The heart of any Puppetry Gaming setup is the DM's theater - a portable stage that serves as both performance space and storytelling tool. Here's my progress on creating the GM's stage.

## Design Requirements

After considering many approaches, I've identified the key features needed:

**Portability:** Must break down for transport to gaming sessions
**Stability:** Sturdy enough for animated GMing without wobbling  
**Versatility:** Adaptable for different room and table setups.
**Storage:** Built-in compartments for puppets, props, and accessories
**Sightlines:** Optimal viewing angles for 4-6 players around a table

## Current Progress

### Frame Construction
- **Materials:** PVC piping (1 inch)
- **Dimensions:** 36" wide x 36" deep x 60" tall when assembled
- **Assembly:** I do not glue any of the pipes into the joints, so setup takes 5 minutes.
- **Status:** Frame complete, currently spray painting the pipes to be a theatrical gold color.

### Stage Elements
- **Backdrop System:** Curtains my wife found at our local Swap Shop.  I hemmed them myself with a sewing machine (my first time sewing!).
- **Props Storage:** The top of the theater is open, but I have a crossbar pvc pipe that will act as a rod to hang puppets and lights from.
- **Status:** Curtains ready, dark blue curtains on the sides and the back, gold curtains in the front.

## Challenges Encountered

**Weight vs. Durability:** Finding the balance between portability and sturdiness required multiple design iterations.

**Puppet Manipulation Space:** Ensuring enough room for puppet movements while keeping the theater compact.

**Multi-Level Staging:** Creating depth and multiple playing areas within the limited space.  Do I need a GM's screen or not?


## Next Steps

- Test with actual gameplay session
- Add integrated lighting mounts
- Add sound

The theater is getting close to being ready for a test run.
