The heart of any Puppetry Gaming setup is the DM's theater - a portable stage that serves as both performance space and storytelling tool. Here's my progress on creating the ultimate gaming theater.

## Design Requirements

After extensive planning, I've identified the key features needed:

**Portability:** Must break down for transport to gaming sessions
**Stability:** Sturdy enough for animated puppeteering without wobbling  
**Versatility:** Adaptable for different story settings and scenes
**Storage:** Built-in compartments for puppets, props, and accessories
**Sightlines:** Optimal viewing angles for 4-6 players around a table

## Current Progress

### Frame Construction
- **Materials:** Lightweight hardwood with reinforced joints
- **Dimensions:** 36" wide x 24" deep x 30" tall when assembled
- **Assembly:** Custom hinges allow 5-minute setup/breakdown
- **Status:** Frame complete, testing joint stability

### Stage Elements
- **Backdrop System:** Modular painted panels for different environments
- **Flooring:** Removable scene bases (dungeon, forest, tavern, etc.)
- **Props Storage:** Hidden compartments in base and sides
- **Status:** Backdrop hangers installed, working on scene bases

## Challenges Encountered

**Weight vs. Durability:** Finding the balance between portability and sturdiness required multiple design iterations.

**Puppet Manipulation Space:** Ensuring enough room for complex puppet movements while keeping the theater compact.

**Multi-Level Staging:** Creating depth and multiple playing areas within the limited space.

## Solutions and Innovations

**Telescoping Support:** Adjustable height supports allow for both seated and standing puppeteering.

**Magnetic Accessories:** Scene elements and props attach magnetically for quick changes.

**Modular Design:** Everything breaks down into pieces that fit in a single carrying case.

## Next Steps

- Test with actual gameplay session
- Add integrated lighting mounts
- Create quick-reference guide for setup
- Build specialized puppet storage system

The theater is becoming more than just a stage - it's evolving into a complete storytelling environment that enhances every aspect of the gaming experience.
